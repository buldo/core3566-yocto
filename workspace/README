This layer was created by the OpenEmbedded devtool utility in order to
contain recipes and bbappends that are currently being worked on. The idea
is that the contents is temporary - once you have finished working on a
recipe you use the appropriate method to move the files you have been
working on to a proper layer. In most instances you should use the
devtool utility to manage files within it rather than modifying files
directly (although recipes added with "devtool add" will often need
direct modification.)

If you no longer need to use devtool or the workspace layer's contents
you can remove the path to this workspace layer from your conf/bblayers.conf
file (and then delete the layer, if you wish).

Note that by default, if devtool fetches and unpacks source code, it
will place it in a subdirectory of a "sources" subdirectory of the
layer. If you prefer it to be elsewhere you can specify the source
tree path on the command line.
